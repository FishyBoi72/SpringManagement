I chose Maven as the build tool because it’s popular in the Java community and makes managing dependencies and building the project easy.
Maven’s default setup saved me time, so I could focus more on coding.
It works well with IntelliJ IDEA, making it simple to add the Spring libraries I needed, like Spring Core and Spring Context.
I used Spring’s features for managing objects and injecting dependencies, which Maven handled smoothly.
One challenge was getting the dependencies to work together, but Maven helped fix those issues.
Another challenge was ditching the springboot website and manually finding the dependencies I needed for my pom.xml.
I kept the project simple by using an in-memory list for managing customers, so I didn’t need to set up a database.
Overall, Maven was a good choice because it made the setup and development process smoother.
